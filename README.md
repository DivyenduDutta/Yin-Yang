Yin Yang is a shoot em up for Android written in Unity. Its a vertical slice and features only 1 complete level. Check it out on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DivineSense.YinYang">Play Store</a> and here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoMllJXDqZw">trailer</a>
Inspired from Ikaruga, Yin Yang uses the polarity mechanic to switch between the light and dark states. Use this to your advantage in navigating the bullets on screen. This looks like a bullet hell but is much more than that.

## Story

Beings of light and dark inhabit the faraway world of Tighil Krad, in peace. But alas, they've been invaded by creatures of the void, come to conquer their planet, and use this ability for nefarious purposes.

Saara, a warrior of the planet is the only one who can protect her homeland from these foreign invaders. She possesses the unique ability called 'Edge of Duality' which allows her to manipulate external entities like enemy ships between light and dark. This unique ability allows her to pilot a special ship named 'Koel' which can switch between light and dark.

Will she be able to protect her land or will she fail?
